# Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier with GUI

An **interactive AI project** that classifies images of cats and dogs using **deep learning** and **transfer learning**.  
This project demonstrates the power of **TensorFlow, Keras, and MobileNetV2**, combined with a simple GUI for instant predictions.

## Key Highlights

- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet for efficient feature extraction.
- **Binary Classification:** Predicts whether an image is of a cat or a dog.
- **Interactive GUI:** Built with Tkinter, allowing dynamic image uploads and real-time predictions.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Trains on a small dataset yet provides accurate results.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** A perfect project to understand image classification and deep learning concepts.

## Project Structure

- **Training Script (`project25.py`)** – Prepares data, builds the model, and trains using transfer learning.
- **GUI Script (`gui_predict.py`)** – Provides an interactive interface for uploading images and seeing predictions.
- **Data Folders (`data/cats` & `data/dogs`)** – Contains sample images for training.
- **Model Folder (`model`)** – Stores the trained model for inference.
